Included files:



Shuffle.cpp  -  written by me. Performs a perfect shuffle operation on a list.


List.cpp  -  written by me. The List ADT is a Doubly Linked List that includes a cursor for iteration. The elements themselves are not indexed; the cursor is a vertical bar standing between two elements, which cannot become undefined. A list containing n elements will have n+1 possible cursor positions: 0 signifying the front of the list, through n+1, the back.

List.h  -  provided by the Professor. A header file for the List ADT which contains the exported List operations.


ListTest.cpp  -  provided by me. A test file for the List ADT.


README  -  written by me. A description of each file submitted for pa5.


Makefile  -  provided by the Professor. Compiles the source code.
