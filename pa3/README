Graph.h - provided by the Professor. A header file for the Graph ADT which contains the exported Graph operations.


List.c  -  written by me. The List ADT is a bi-directional queue that includes a cursor for iteration.


List.h  -  provided by the Professor. A header file for the List ADT which contains the exported List operations.


GraphTest.c - written by me. A test file for the Graph ADT.


README  -  written by me. A description of each file submitted for pa3.


Makefile  -  provided by the Professor. Compiles the source code.



Note to grader: 
The Graph ADT methods getPath() and BFS() algorithms were taken from the Professor's example code.
