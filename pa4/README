Included files:



FindComponents.c -  written by me. The top-level client for the Graph ADT.


Graph.c - written by me. The Graph ADT and its associated algorithms can perform Depth First Search (DFS) and can Transpose a Graph.


Graph.h - provided by the Professor. A header file for the Graph ADT which contains the exported Graph operations.


List.c  -  written by me. The List ADT is a bi-directional queue that includes a cursor for iteration.


List.h  -  provided by the Professor. A header file for the List ADT which contains the exported List operations.


GraphTest.c - written by me. A test file for the Graph ADT.


README  -  written by me. A description of each file submitted.


Makefile  -  provided by the Professor. Compiles the source code.



Note to grader: 
The Graph ADT methods DFS() and Visit() algorithms were modeled from the Professor's example code.
FindComponents and Graph executes without memory leaks.
All public exported methods of the Graph ADT (all methods found in the Graph.h file) are tested in GraphTest.c.
